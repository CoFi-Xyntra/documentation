Welcome aboard Xyntra (formerly CoFi), the revolutionary AI copilot that's turbocharging Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in Web3! Imagine navigating the vast cosmos of blockchain with a trusty AI sidekick that understands your every command in plain English. No more fumbling with clunky interfaces or deciphering cryptic contracts—Xyntra simplifies transfers, swaps, staking, and more, all while executing smart contracts directly from your chat responses.

Built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, Xyntra unifies multiple blockchains into one seamless network using cutting-edge chain-key technology. Say goodbye to chain-hopping hassles and hello to a decentralized, AI-driven future where DeFi is as easy as chatting with a friend.

## 🌌 Why Xyntra? The DeFi Dilemma Solved
In the wild frontier of Web3, DeFi is powerful but perilous: complex UIs, fragmented chains, and steep learning curves scare off millions. Xyntra bridges this gap by integrating advanced GPT-like AI models with on-chain execution. Our mission? Democratize DeFi, making it accessible, secure, and fun for everyone—from crypto newbies to seasoned traders.
Key Concerns We Tackle:
- Usability Barriers: Turn "Swap 1 ETH for USDC" into a simple chat command.
- Interoperability Issues: ICP's chain-key magic lets you interact with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more from one unified platform.
- Security & Privacy: Non-custodial, on-chain validation ensures your assets stay yours.
Powered by ICP's "World Computer" architecture, Xyntra delivers unstoppable, censorship-resistant DeFi experiences. Learn more about ICP here.

## ✨ Core Features: AI Meets DeFi

## 💰 Tokenomics: Fueling the Xyntra Ecosystem
$XYN is the heartbeat of our platform—used for fees, governance, and rewards. Total Supply: 100,000,000 $XYN.
| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Vesting/Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founders/Team | 15% | 15,000,000 | 3-year vest, 1-year cliff: Long-term alignment. |
| Investors | 20% | 20,000,000 | 2-year vest: Seed funding for dev & marketing. |
| Community | 25% | 25,000,000 | Engagement rewards, DAOs, and airdrops. |
| Airdrop | 10% | 10,000,000 | Early adopters & ICP holders: Bootstrap network. |
| Liquidity | 15% | 15,000,000 | Initial DEX pools for stable trading. |
| Staking Rewards | 10% | 10,000,000 | 5-year distribution: Secure the network. |
| Treasury | 5% | 5,000,000 | R&D, audits, partnerships. |

Deflationary twists: Transaction fees burn $XYN, ensuring scarcity. Community governance via staking unlocks proposal voting.
